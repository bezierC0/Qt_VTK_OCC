## Dependencies

*   Qt 5
*   OpenCASCADE Technology (OCC)
*   The Visualization Toolkit (VTK)

## Compilation Method

This project uses CMake as the build system.

1.  **Configure the project:**
    Create a build directory and run CMake. You may need to provide paths to the dependencies if they are not in standard locations.

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. 
    ```
    *Note: You might need to specify your generator (e.g., "Visual Studio 16 2019") and paths to Qt, VTK, and OpenCASCADE.*

2.  **Build the project:**
    Compile the source code using the build system generated by CMake.

    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```
    Alternatively, you can open the generated project file (e.g., `.sln` for Visual Studio) in your IDE and build it from there.
